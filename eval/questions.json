In ALS, mutations in autophagy-related genes (TBK1, OPTN, SQSTM1/p62, VCP, UBQLN2) directly impair this clearance system. TBK1 phosphorylates autophagy receptors optineurin and p62. C9orf72 protein also regulates autophagy initiation. When autophagy fails, toxic protein aggregates (TDP-43, SOD1) accumulate and cannot be cleared. This creates a vicious cycle where aggregates further impair autophagy machinery.",

    "verified_answer": "Advance care planning in ALS must address several disease-specific decisions. The most critical is whether the patient wants invasive mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy if respiratory failure occurs, as this can extend survival significantly but results in a locked-in state for most patients. Other decisions include: preferences for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) duration and settings; PEG tube placement timing; hospitalization preferences during acute events; resuscitation (CPR/DNR) status, noting that standard CPR often leads to unwanted intubation; desired place of death (home vs hospice vs hospital); and whether to continue or withdraw life-sustaining treatments. These discussions should begin early while the patient retains full cognitive and communication capacity, since up to 50% develop some cognitive impairment.",

    "verified_answer": "Respiratory function monitoring in ALS is essential because respiratory failure is the primary cause of death. Forced vital capacity (FVC) is measured at every clinic visit (typically every 2-3 months) using spirometry, with values reported as a percentage of predicted. Supplementary measures include maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP), and nocturnal pulse oximetry. Symptoms of respiratory insufficiency include orthopnea (breathlessness when lying flat), morning headaches (from CO2 retention), excessive daytime sleepiness, and reduced speech volume.

Management includes: neuropsychological screening at diagnosis and periodically using tools like the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS); SSRIs for behavioral symptoms; environmental modifications to ensure safety; caregiver education about behavioral changes being disease-driven; establishing legal decision-making capacity and advance directives early; and caregiver support programs, as behavioral-variant ALS-FTD places extreme burden on caregivers.",

Psychological burden includes anticipatory grief, depression (affecting 30-40% of caregivers), anxiety, social isolation, and financial stress. Studies show caregiver burden correlates with patient functional decline (particularly on bulbar and respiratory domains) rather than simply disease duration. Support resources include: respite care programs, caregiver support groups (ALS Association, MND Association), psychological counseling, home health aide services, hospice support, and financial assistance programs.

Early voice banking (recording the patient's voice for later use in speech-generating devices) is recommended while speech is still intelligible. For swallowing, SLPs perform clinical and instrumental swallow assessments (videofluoroscopy, FEES), recommend texture modifications, teach safe swallowing strategies, and help determine timing for PEG tube referral.",

Key hospice services include: aggressive symptom management (pain, dyspnea, anxiety, secretions), emotional and spiritual support for patients and families, assistance with treatment withdrawal decisions (particularly NIV and feeding tubes), medication management for terminal symptoms (morphine for air hunger, benzodiazepines for anxiety, anticholinergics for secretions), bereavement support for families, and coordination of home-based care to honor preferences for dying at home.",
